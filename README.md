# Mini KSP-style space simulatron

(Original LeedsHack 2015 submission is in branch "lh2015-entry".)

Requirements: Python 2.x, Pygame.

Features:
* Inaccurate physics simulation
* Unrealistic atmospheric modelling
* Dodgy orbital mechanics
* Corporate sponsorship!

Keys:
* a/d: rotate anticlockwise/clockwise
* w/s: throttle up/down
* z: full throttle
* x: kill throttle
* t: toggle SAS
* p: deploy parachute
* m: toggle map screen
* -/=: zoom map
* ,/.: increase/decrease timewarp
* q: quit

*[Full version coming eventually.  Watch this space.]*
